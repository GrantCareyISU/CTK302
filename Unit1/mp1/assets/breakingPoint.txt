Years later, after rising through the ranks of the syndicate at a horrifying speed, Kevin Dustin was sent by the crimelord, known as Metal Grip, on a task he believed to be impossible upon assigning it to Kevin: Assassinate Governor Conners, who was cracking down on arresting their members. Brutally slaughtering every security guard, Kevin decapitates Charles Conners. As he prepares to leave, though, he notices a small photograph that slipped out of the governor's pocket upon his body falling to the floor. The picture showed Charles with Bianca. With the revelation that he just killed his own father, Kevin Dustin's mind spiraled even further into madness.
